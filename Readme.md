# Hyper's Linktree

This is just a personal Linktree Webpage, so nothing special here. It will probably get updates rarely, since I don't really have ideas. Anyways, take a look at the website by going [here](https://hypr-linktr.github.io/-/). That's about it, I guess.

# Main Account

Also, this isn't my main github account. I know it is mentioned in the website but here we go. Here is my [real](https://twitter.com/) github account.
